# Generative text 
This repository contains example source files and notes for a (virtual) talk I gave to students at [UAL Creative Computing Institute](https://www.arts.ac.uk/creative-computing-institute) in November 2020.

## Notes
Links and further reading for the talk can be found in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).

## Code samples

### Tracery
* I ported Strachey's love letter algorithm to Tracery for this talk; you can find that in [strachery.json](strachery.json)
* Source for [@animalshorrible]() can be found in [animalshorrible.json](animalshorrible.json).

### Markov chains
* There's a bunch of code in [markov](markov) for downloading source text, training a Markov model (using the [Markovify library](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify)) and generating text from that model.
